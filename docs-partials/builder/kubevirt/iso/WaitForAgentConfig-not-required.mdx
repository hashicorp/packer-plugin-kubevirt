- `agent_wait_timeout` (duration string | ex: "1h5m2s") - AgentWaitTimeout is the amount of time to wait for the QEMU Guest Agent to be
  available.
  If the Guest Agent does not become available before the timeout, the installation
  will be cancelled. When set to `0s`, waiting for the guest agent to be available
  is skipped. Defaults to `0s` (do not wait for the QEMU Guest Agent).
  Refer to the Golang [ParseDuration](https://golang.org/pkg/time/#ParseDuration)
  documentation for full details.
