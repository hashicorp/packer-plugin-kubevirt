- `media_label` (string) - Label is the disk volume label to use on the virtual drive
  constructed and attached to the VM. This is ignored for Windows systems.
  Defaults to `OEMDRV`.

- `media_files` ([]string) - Files is a list of files to be copied into the generated ConfigMap
  which is used to provide additional install-time files to the VM.
  Defaults to an empty list.

- `media_content` (map[string]string) - Content is a map of content to include in the generated media volume.
  The map keys are the filenames and the map values are the file
  contents.  This permits the use of HCL functions such as `file` and
  `templatefile` to populate the ConfigMap.
  If a filename matches a file included in `media_files` then the
  contents specified here takes precedence.
  Defaults to an empty list.

- `keep_media` (bool) - If true, KeepMedia indicates that the created ConfigMap consisting
  of files (provided via `media_files` or `media_content`) should not
  be removed at the end of the build . If false, the ConfigMap will
  be removed.
  
  This can be useful for debugging purposes, to inspect the generated
  ConfigMap contents. However, it is recommended that this is set
  to false for regular production use.
