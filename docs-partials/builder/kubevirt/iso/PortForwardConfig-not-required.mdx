- `disable_forwarding` (bool) - If true, disable the built-in port forwarding via Kubernetes control-plane.
  By default, the Kubernetes control-plane forwarding is used.

- `forwarding_port` (int) - ForwardingPort is the local port used for port-forwarding to the VM for the
  appropriate communicator. If this is not set, or set to 0, then a local ephemeral
  port will be allocated during the build process and used as the forwarding port.
