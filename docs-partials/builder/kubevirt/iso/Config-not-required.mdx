- `instance_type_kind` (string) - InstanceTypeKind is the kind of the InstanceType resource to use in the temporary VM.
  Other supported value is "virtualmachineclusterinstancetype".

- `preference_kind` (string) - PreferenceKind is the kind of the Preference resource to use in the temporary VM.
  Other supported value is "virtualmachineclusterpreference".

- `os_type` (string) - OperatingSystemType is the type of operating system to install.
  Supported values are "linux" and "windows". Default is "linux".

- `networks` ([]Network) - Networks is a list of networks to attach to the temporary VM.
  If no networks are specified, a single pod network will be used.

- `media_files` ([]string) - MediaFiles is a path list of files to be copied and used during the ISO installation.

- `boot_command` ([]string) - BootCommand is a list of strings that represent the keystrokes to be sent to the VM console
  to automate the installation via a new VNC connection.

- `boot_wait` (duration string | ex: "1h5m2s") - BootWait is the amount of time to wait before sending the boot command.
  This is useful if the VM takes some time to boot and be ready to accept keystrokes.

- `ssh_local_port` (int) - SSHLocalPort is the local port to use to connect via SSH.

- `winrm_local_port` (int) - WinRMLocalPort is the local port to use to connect via WinRM.

- `keep_vm` (bool) - KeepVM indicates whether to keep the temporary VM after the image has been created.
  If false, the VM and all its resources will be deleted after the image is created.
  If true, only the VM resource will be kept, all other resources will be deleted.
  Default is false.
  
  This can be useful for debugging purposes, to inspect the VM and its disks.
  However, it is recommended to set this to false in production environments to avoid
  resource leaks.
