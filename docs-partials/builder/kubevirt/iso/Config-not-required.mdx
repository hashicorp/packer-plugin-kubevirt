- `vm_name` (string) - VMName is the name of the temporary VM instance. If not specified,
  it will default to the same value as the Name. VMName is also used as
  the base for naming other temporary resources such as the ConfigMap.

- `instance_type_kind` (string) - InstanceTypeKind is the kind of the InstanceType resource to use in the temporary VM.
  Other supported value is "virtualmachineclusterinstancetype".

- `preference_kind` (string) - PreferenceKind is the kind of the Preference resource to use in the temporary VM.
  Other supported value is "virtualmachineclusterpreference".

- `os_type` (string) - OperatingSystemType is the type of operating system to install.
  Supported values are "linux" and "windows". Default is "linux".

- `networks` ([]Network) - Networks is a list of networks to attach to the temporary VM.
  If no networks are specified, a single pod network will be used.

- `boot_command` ([]string) - BootCommand is a list of strings that represent the keystrokes to be sent to the VM console
  to automate the installation via a new VNC connection.

- `boot_wait` (duration string | ex: "1h5m2s") - BootWait is the amount of time to wait before sending the boot command.
  This is useful if the VM takes some time to boot and be ready to accept keystrokes.

- `installation_wait_timeout` (duration string | ex: "1h5m2s") - InstallationWaitTimeout is the amount of time to wait for the installation to be completed.

- `ssh_local_port` (int) - SSHLocalPort is the local port to use to connect via SSH.

- `winrm_local_port` (int) - WinRMLocalPort is the local port to use to connect via WinRM.

- `keep_vm` (bool) - KeepVM indicates whether to keep the temporary VM after the image has been created.
  If false, the VM and all its resources will be deleted after the image is created.
  If true, only the VM resource will be kept, all other resources will be deleted.
  Default is false.
  
  This can be useful for debugging purposes, to inspect the VM and its disks.
  However, it is recommended to set this to false in production environments to avoid
  resource leaks.
